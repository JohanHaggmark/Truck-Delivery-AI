# Truck-Delivery-AI
This was a school project. I have implemented an AI to learn to play Truck Delivery against a BOT. The BOT is constant and can not evolve, but the AI will evolve when playing the game. A neural network combined with monte carlo tree search decides what move should be made.  The result of this project is documented in a report, written in swedish.   
An AI training to beat the BOT in Truck Delivery. Inpired by alpha zero, I wanted to create an AI that was could learn to play my game
